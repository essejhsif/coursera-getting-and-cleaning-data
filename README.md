This is the Github repository for the Coursera course 'Getting and Cleaning Data' project. 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

The submissions includes:
- A tidy data set
- run_analysis.R
- A codebook
- README.md file

1. Read in and then merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Read in features data, extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Read the activity_labels and use only descriptive activity names 
4. Get a list of current column labels and then tidy
5. Find the mean for each subject/label and then create the tidy data set (tidy_data_set.txt)
